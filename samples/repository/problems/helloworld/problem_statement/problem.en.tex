\problemname{Hello World!}

This is probably the first problem you will solve and it should help you set up and test your system. Solve this problem first to make sure everything is in place.

We would like to introduce you to Lea. You will meet her in many of the problems you will solve. After reading all of them you will know her quite well.

Lea is a very friendly person who likes to say hello to everybody, but she doesn't want to say the same thing to every person she meets. Therefore, she never knows what to say. For greeting Bob it is appropriate to say ``Hello Bob!'', whereas for greeting Peter it is better to say ``Hello Peter!''. Help her and tell her which sentence to use.

\section*{Output}
% detailed description of the output format

For each test case, print a line containing ``Case \#$i$: Hello $s$!'' where $i$ is its number, starting at 1. Each line of the output should end with a line break.

\section*{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
	\item $1\leq t\leq 20$
